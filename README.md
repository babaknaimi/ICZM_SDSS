## A Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM)

This is the source code for a project I implemented in Python. This is a simple desktop GIS application that provides some functionality for visualizing and processing some specific Iranian ICZM data that helps for decision making and planning spatially. In addition, some tools were developed to link this application to a bigger Enterprise GIS that my team and I had implemented for the PMO organization in Iran. 

Here is just the source code that might help someone in understanding how the relevant modules and libraries are utilized. The GUI is based on PyQT4, and different geospatial libraries in Python were employed in this project. Feel free to take a look at the codes.

Good luck!
